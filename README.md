## What is emb-agent?

When you work on embedded firmware with an AI assistant, you spend a lot of time repeating the same information: which MCU you're using, what pins are connected, what peripherals matter, what the timing constraints are. emb-agent fixes this by putting all that hardware knowledge into files inside your repo.

Once the hardware truth is written down, the AI reads it automatically at the start of every session. No more re-explaining your board setup in chat.

emb-agent works with **Claude Code**, **Codex**, and **Cursor**. The same `.emb-agent/` folder drives all three.

### What you get

| Feature | How it helps |
|---|---|
| **Hardware truth files** | Write your MCU model, package, pins, and peripherals once in `.emb-agent/hw.yaml`. The AI reads them every session. |
| **Requirements file** | Keep project goals, interfaces, and constraints in `.emb-agent/req.yaml` so the AI knows what you're building. |
| **Simple command flow** | Most projects just need `declare hardware`, `next`, and the execution loop. |
| **Document ingestion** | Feed in datasheets and schematics — the AI extracts chip facts and writes them into your truth files. |
| **Chip-specific logic** | Timer calculations, register formulas, and vendor-specific rules live in pluggable modules, not in the core workflow. |
| **Built-in verification** | Every task closes with a review step, not just "code compiles and looks right." |
| **Knowledge graph** | Auto-generated map connecting chips, registers, formulas, wiki pages, and tasks — so the AI can trace relationships. |
| **Auto-startup** | SessionStart hook injects project state automatically. You don't need to run a setup command. |

### Supported AI tools

| Platform | Where it installs | Auto-startup | Activity tracking |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/` or `.claude/` | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Codex** | `~/.codex/` or `.codex/` | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Cursor** | `~/.cursor/` or `.cursor/` | ✅ | ✅ |

## Quick Start

### 1. Install into your project

```bash
npx emb-agent
```

This opens an interactive installer. It asks which AI tool you use, then sets everything up. For a one-command install with Claude Code:

```bash
npx emb-agent --claude --local --developer "Your Name"
```

### 2. Open a new session

Start a new session in your AI tool. emb-agent automatically injects the project context — you don't need to run any command. On the first session, it initializes the project and tells you what to do next.

### 3. Tell it about your hardware

**If you know your MCU:**
```bash
declare hardware --mcu SC8F072 --package SOP8
bootstrap run --confirm
next run
```

**If you haven't chosen a chip yet:**
```text
Describe your goals and constraints in .emb-agent/req.yaml, then run "next"
```

**If the truth is in a datasheet or schematic:**
```bash
ingest doc --file docs/PMS150G.pdf --kind datasheet --to hardware
# or for schematics
ingest schematic --file schematic.pdf
```

## Automating with emb-agent

If you're building scripts or tooling around emb-agent, use these machine-readable surfaces:

| Command | Returns |
|---|---|
| `next --brief` | Compact JSON with the recommended next action |
| `external status` | Stable envelope with project health summary |
| `external health` | Hardware and workflow health report |
| `task worktree status` | Status of isolated task workspaces |

Every response includes a **runtime event** level (`clear`, `ok`, `pending`, `blocked`, `failed`) that tells your script whether it's safe to proceed.

## How it's built

emb-agent has three layers:

1. **Workflow layer** — the commands you run: `start`, `declare hardware`, `next`, `task`, `ingest`. These guide the AI through hardware-first development.
2. **Chip-support layer** — chip-specific formulas, register maps, and tool logic. Kept separate so the core stays lean.
3. **Host layer** — skills, hooks, and commands that adapt emb-agent to Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor.

When chip support shows up in a report, it's labeled by readiness:
- `reusable` — ready for any project using that chip
- `reusable-candidate` — nearly ready, needs review
- `project-only` — keep it local for now
